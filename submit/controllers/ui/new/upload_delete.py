    Handle a request to delete a file.

    The file will only be deleted if a POST request is made that also contains
    the ``confirmed`` parameter.

    The process can be initiated with a GET request that contains the
    ``path`` (key) for the file to be deleted. For example, a button on
    the upload interface may link to the deletion route with the file path
    as a query parameter. This will generate a deletion confirmation form,
    which can be POSTed to complete the action.

    Parameters
    ----------
    method : str
        ``GET`` or ``POST``
    params : :class:`MultiDict`
        The query or form data from the request.
    session : :class:`Session`
        The authenticated session for the request.
    submission_id : int
